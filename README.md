# Tech-School 🏫

**Tech-School** is my final personal project from my web development training program.  
It is a dynamic website built with PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL that simulates a modern tech school, including a home page, user registration/login system, activity descriptions, and a contact section.

I poured my heart into this project ❤️, and I'm proud to share it.
